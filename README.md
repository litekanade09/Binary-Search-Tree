This section focuses on the Binary Search Tree (BST), a specialized type of binary tree that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.

Definition and Structure: Explained a BST as a binary tree where each node follows the property that its left child contains values less than the node's value, and its right child contains values greater than the node's value.

Basic Operations: Demonstrated key operations, including insertion, deletion, and searching, providing code examples to illustrate how these operations maintain the BST properties.

Traversal Methods: Discussed traversal techniques specific to BSTs, such as in-order traversal (which returns sorted values), pre-order, and post-order traversals.

Performance Analysis: Analyzed the time complexity of operations in a balanced BST, noting that average-case performance is O(log n), while worst-case performance can degrade to O(n) in unbalanced trees.

Applications: Highlighted practical applications of BSTs, such as implementing dynamic sets, creating associative arrays, and serving as the basis for more complex data structures like AVL trees and Red-Black trees.
